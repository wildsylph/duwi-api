# duwi-api

API for uwi-bot, the Duwi Discord Bot.

<!-- dash-content-start -->

This is a Cloudflare Worker with OpenAPI 3.1 Auto Generation and Validation using [chanfana](https://github.com/cloudflare/chanfana) and [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono).

This project builds an OpenAPI compliant Worker that generates the
`openapi.json` schema automatically from code and validates the incoming request to the defined parameters or request body.

## Setup Steps

1. Install the project dependencies with a package manager of your choice:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Create a [D1 database](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/get-started/) with the name "duwidb":
   ```bash
   npx wrangler d1 create duwidb
   ```
   ...and update the `database_id` field in `wrangler.json` with the new database ID.
3. Run the following db migration to initialize the database (notice the `migrations` directory in this project):
   ```bash
   npx wrangler d1 migrations apply DB --remote
   ```
4. Deploy the project!
   ```bash
   npx wrangler deploy
   ```
5. Monitor your worker
   ```bash
   npx wrangler tail
   ```

## Testing

This template includes integration tests using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/). To run the tests locally:

```bash
npm run test
```

Test files are located in the `tests/` directory, with examples demonstrating how to test your endpoints and database interactions.

However, I have yet to create any tests.

## Endpoints
- /users
- /guilds
- /points
- /security
- settings
- /setting-types
- /transactions
- /cumulative-call-time

## Project structure

1. Your main router is defined in `src/index.ts`.
2. Each endpoint has its own file in `src/endpoints/`.
3. Integration tests are located in the `tests/` directory.
4. For more information read the [chanfana documentation](https://chanfana.com/), [Hono documentation](https://hono.dev/docs), and [Vitest documentation](https://vitest.dev/guide/).
